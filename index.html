            <span id="first-word">Hello!</span> I'm Ece, a first-year software engineering student at FSCE FINKI. As a recent high school graduate, I've started an exciting journey to learn the world of programming and technology. During my time in high school, I had the opportunity to contribute to the design part of our school's newspaper, where I developed my creative skills and got a keen eye for visual aesthetics. I believe that with dedication and hard-work, anything is attainable. I embrace the philosophy that hard work and determination are the driving forces behind success. I'm passionate about leveraging my technical expertise to create innovative solutions and contribute to the ever-evolving field of software engineering.

            <span id="first-word">Beyond</span> academics, I'm passionate about music and sports. With eight years of training in piano from a music school, I've cultivated a strong foundation in playing. Recently, I've also ventured into learning the guitar. Skiing is another cherished hobby of mine, providing an exhilarating escape every winter. Which also has given me many good friends. I thrive on continuous learning, whether exploring programming languages or delving into art forms like knitting, crocheting, painting, and jewellery making. This love for creativity enhances my life and fostering growth.
